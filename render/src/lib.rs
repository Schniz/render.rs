//! > üîè A safe and simple template engine with the ergonomics of JSX
//!
//! `render` itself is a combination of traits, structs and macros that together unify and
//! boost the experience of composing tree-shaped data structures. This works best with HTML and
//! XML rendering, but can work with other usages as well, like ReasonML's [`Pastel`](https://reason-native.com/docs/pastel/) library for terminal colors.
//!
//! # How?
//!
//! A renderable component is a struct that implements the `Render` trait. There
//! are multiple macros that provide a better experience implementing Renderable:
//!
//! * `#[component]` for defining components using a function
//! * `rsx!` for composing elements with JSX ergonomics
//! * `html!` for composing elements and render them to a string
//!
//! # Why is this different from...
//!
//! ## `handlebars`?
//!
//! Handlebars is an awesome spec that lets us devs define templates and work
//! seemlessly between languages and frameworks. Unfortunately, it does not guarantee any of Rust's
//! type-safety, due to its spec. This forces you to write tests for validating types for your views, like you would in a dynamically typed language. These tests weren't necessary in a type-safe language like Rust ‚Äî but Handlebars is JSON-oriented, which doesn't comply Rust's type system.
//!
//! `render` provides the same level of type-safety Rust provides, with no compromises of
//! ergonomics or speed.
//!
//! ## `typed-html`?
//!
//! `typed-html` is a wonderful library. Unfortunately, it focused its power in strictness of the HTML spec itself, and doesn't allow arbitrary compositions of custom elements.
//!
//! `render` takes a different approach. For now, HTML is not typed at all. It can get any key and get any string value. The main focus is custom components, so you can create a composable and declarative template with no runtime errors.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ## Simple HTML rendering
//!
//! In order to render a simple HTML fragment into a `String`, use the `rsx!` macro to generate a
//! component tree, and call `render_to_string` on it:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use pretty_assertions::assert_eq;
//!
//! use render::{rsx, Render, render_to_string};
//!
//! let tree = rsx! {
//!   <div>
//!     <h1>{"Hello!"}</h1>
//!     <p>{"Hello world!"}</p>
//!   </div>
//! };
//!
//! assert_eq!(render_to_string(tree), "<div><h1>Hello!</h1><p>Hello world!</p></div>");
//! ```
//!
//! Because this is so common, there's another macro called `html!` that calls `rsx!` to generate
//! a component tree, and then calls `render` on it. Most of the time, you'll find yourself using
//! the `rsx!` macro to compose arbitrary components, and only calling `html!` when you need a
//! String output, when sending a response or generating a Markdown file.
//!
//! In Render, attributes and plain strings are escaped using the `render::html_escaping` module. In order to
//! use un-escaped values so you can dangerously insert raw HTML, use the `raw!` macro around your
//! string:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use pretty_assertions::assert_eq;
//!
//! use render::{html, raw};
//!
//! let tree = html! {
//!   <div>
//!     <p>{"<Hello />"}</p>
//!     <p>{raw!("<Hello />")}</p>
//!   </div>
//! };
//!
//! assert_eq!(tree, "<div><p>&lt;Hello /&gt;</p><p><Hello /></p></div>");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Custom components
//!
//! Render's greatest ability is to provide type-safety along with custom renderable components.
//! Introducing new components is as easy as defining a function that returns a `Render` value.
//!
//! In order to build up components from other components or HTML nodes, you can use the `rsx!`
//! macro, which generates a `Render` component tree:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use pretty_assertions::assert_eq;
//!
//! use render::{component, rsx, html};
//!
//! #[component]
//! fn Heading<'title>(title: &'title str) {
//!   rsx! { <h1 class={"title"}>{title}</h1> }
//! }
//!
//! let rendered_html = html! {
//!   <Heading title={"Hello world!"} />
//! };
//!
//! assert_eq!(rendered_html, r#"<h1 class="title">Hello world!</h1>"#);
//! ```
//!
//! If you pay close attention, you see that the function `Heading` is:
//!
//! * declared with an uppercase. Underneath, it generates a struct with the same name, and
//! implements the `Render` trait on it.
//! * does not have a return type. This is because everything is written to a writer, for
//! performance reasons.
//!
//! ### Full example
//!
//! ```rust
//! // A simple HTML 5 doctype declaration
//! use render::html::HTML5Doctype;
//! use render::{
//!     // A macro to create components
//!     component,
//!     // A macro to compose components in JSX fashion
//!     rsx,
//!     // A macro to render components in JSX fashion
//!     html,
//!     // A trait for custom components
//!     Render,
//! };
//!
//! // This can be any layout we want
//! #[component]
//! fn Page<'a, Children: Render>(title: &'a str, children: Children) {
//!    rsx! {
//!      <>
//!        <HTML5Doctype />
//!        <html>
//!          <head><title>{title}</title></head>
//!          <body>
//!            {children}
//!          </body>
//!        </html>
//!      </>
//!    }
//! }
//!
//! // This can be a route in Rocket, the web framework,
//! // for instance.
//! pub fn some_page(user_name: &str) -> String {
//!     html! {
//!       <Page title={"Home"}>
//!         {format!("Welcome, {}", user_name)}
//!       </Page>
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # use pretty_assertions::assert_eq;
//! # let actual = some_page("Gal");
//! # let expected = concat!(
//! #     "<!DOCTYPE html>",
//! #     "<html>",
//! #     "<head><title>Home</title></head>",
//! #     "<body>",
//! #     "Welcome, Gal",
//! #     "</body>",
//! #     "</html>"
//! # );
//! # assert_eq!(actual, expected);
//! ```
